# Modeling and evaluation of model obsolescence
This repository hosts a DSL (grammar) and an obsolescence evaluator (implemented in Python) to identify model obsolescence.

Our model-based approach is described in the following figure: at design-time, you can specify how sensitive to obsolescence are the models (using our grammar) and periodically validate (in the lifespan model monitoring stage) the obsolescence of that models and their internal elements.

You can consult our mobility case example, including:

* The [mobility domain model](https://github.com/BESSER-PEARL/ModelObsolescence/blob/main/img/mobilitycase.png): this domain model was implemented using [BESSER platform](https://github.com/BESSER-PEARL/BESSER). The implementation of the model is here.
* The [obsolescence rules definition](https://github.com/BESSER-PEARL/ModelObsolescence/blob/main/mobility_case/obsolescence_rules.txt) (using our grammar) applied to the domain model
* An [obsolescence report](https://github.com/BESSER-PEARL/ModelObsolescence/blob/main/mobility_case/report.pdf) generated by the obsolescence evaluator.

## Running the Mobility Example

To get started with the mobility example, make sure you're using Python 3.9 or higher. Here's a quick guide to set things up:

1. **Create a virtual environment**: It's a good idea to use a virtual environment like `venv` or `conda` to keep things tidy.
2. **Clone or download this repo**: Grab the code from this repository.
3. **Install the requirements**: Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to get all the dependencies.
4.  **Run the example**: Navigate to the mobility case directory `cd mobility_case` and run the example script `python mobility.py`
5.  **Check  the  report**:  You  should  find  the  obsolescence  report  as  a  PDF  file  in  the  `report`  folder.
